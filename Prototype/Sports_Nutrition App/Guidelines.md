# **AI-Driven Sports Nutrition Web App – Product Requirements Document**

## **Product Overview and Purpose**

The AI-Driven Sports Nutrition Web App is a web-based platform designed to empower sports dietitians and performance staff to deliver personalised nutrition support to elite athletes, academies, and collegiate (NCAA) programmes in the US and UK. The purpose of this product is to streamline and enhance the entire performance nutrition workflow – from athlete data management and meal planning to collaboration and ongoing monitoring – by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) at its core. This **AI-first** design is intended to save practitioners time and ensure that each athlete receives data-driven, individualised nutritional guidance at scale.

Elite sports organisations often face the challenge of a limited number of dietitians serving a large roster of athletes. It’s not uncommon for a single sports dietitian to be responsible for dozens or even hundreds of athletes. For example, the US Olympic & Paralympic Committee has employed AI-powered tools to help one dietitian efficiently create tailored meal plans for \~300 athletes, vastly simplifying what was once a labour-intensive process. This product is conceived to address similar needs across teams and institutions by providing an **intuitive, AI-driven platform** that augments the dietitian’s expertise. Current best-in-class solutions like ZoneIn and Notemeal have demonstrated that automating meal plan generation and personalising guidance to each athlete’s schedule and goals can dramatically improve efficiency and consistency. Building on these insights, our web app will integrate modern standards for AI in sports nutrition (such as automated dietary analysis, intelligent recommendations, and natural language assistance) to deliver targeted nutrition interventions with minimal manual effort.

**Target Users and Use Cases:** The platform is designed for use by professional club dietitians, NCAA sports nutrition staff, high-performance directors, and the athletes themselves. It supports both individual workflows (e.g. one-on-one athlete nutrition coaching) and team-wide initiatives (e.g. creating meal plans for an entire squad or monitoring group trends). In practice, a dietitian can use the app to maintain comprehensive profiles for each player, generate and adjust meal plans (with AI suggesting optimisations), and collaborate with other staff or the athletes in real time. Athletes can log in to view their personalised plans, provide feedback or meal logs, and receive educational insights – all within a unified, secure environment.

Because the initial release is a **closed beta MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**, certain integrations and features will be limited. The MVP will focus on core functionality within a standalone web application, **without** third-party wearable or biometric device integrations and with **no payment processing** (the beta will be provided to select users free of charge). Despite this scope limitation, the product is built with a forward-looking architecture to later incorporate data from wearables, training management systems, and other external APIs as the platform evolves (see the Roadmap section for phased development plans).

In summary, the AI-Driven Sports Nutrition Web App aims to become an indispensable tool for performance nutrition management by combining robust data management, AI-assisted planning, and seamless collaboration. It will help transform the daily practice of sports dietitians – enabling them to deliver **research-backed, personalised meal plans to every athlete efficiently** – and empower athletes with actionable insights into their nutrition, ultimately driving better performance and health outcomes.

## **Core Modules and Functionality**

The product is organised into several core modules, each focusing on a key aspect of the sports nutrition workflow. Below is an overview of each module and its primary functionality:

### **1\. Player Management**
Player Management covers all features related to organising and handling athlete records within the system. This module allows performance staff to create and manage a database of players (athletes) for one or multiple teams or organisations. Key capabilities include adding new players (individually or via bulk import), categorising players into teams or groups, and managing status (active, inactive, graduated, etc.). There will be tools for searching and filtering the player list (e.g. by name, team, position, or nutritional risk status) to quickly locate specific cohorts. Player Management serves as the foundation for all other modules, ensuring that dietitians can easily maintain an up-to-date roster and navigate to individual player information.

In a team context, this module also handles **team and group structures**. For example, a university might have multiple squads (football, basketball, etc.) or an academy might have age-grade teams – the system will support organising players under these units. This hierarchy enables both **individualised support and scalable team-wide actions**. A dietitian could, for instance, select an entire team or subgroup to assign them a general meal plan template or to flag them for a particular intervention. Player Management will ensure that such batch operations are possible while also allowing drill-down into single athletes for personalisation.

### **2\. Player Profiles**

The Player Profiles module is the hub of all information related to an individual athlete. Each player profile will consolidate medical, nutritional, and training-related data to provide a 360° view of the athlete’s status and needs. A profile will typically include:

- **Personal and Anthropometric Data:** Basic details (age, sex, height, weight) and body composition metrics (body fat %, lean mass). The system will allow tracking changes in weight or body comp over time, often critical for monitoring progress.

- **Medical and Dietary Considerations:** Any declared medical conditions, injuries, allergies, or dietary restrictions (e.g. peanut allergy, gluten-free, vegan). This also covers supplementation or medications, and any contraindications.

- **Nutrition Intake & Needs:** Information on the athlete’s typical diet, estimated energy expenditure, and calculated nutritional requirements. The dietitian can record target calorie intake, macronutrient splits (carbs, protein, fat), and key micronutrient goals based on the athlete’s training load and goals. The profile will store these targets and can be updated as needed (for example, during bulking vs. cutting phases, or offseason vs. in-season).

- **Training and Performance Data:** While MVP is not integrated with wearables, the profile can include manually input or CSV-imported data about the athlete’s training schedules, workout intensities, or recent performance tests. Even a simple training calendar or workload level (light/medium/heavy days) can be logged here to inform nutrition planning. Over time, this section could link with external performance tracking systems.

- **Goals and Progress:** The athlete’s goals (e.g. gain 5 kg muscle, improve endurance, reach a target body fat %, recover from injury) as set by the athlete or staff. Progress notes can be logged to document how the athlete is progressing against these goals.

- **Historical Data and Documents:** The profile may store or link to historical reports – for example, past nutrition plans, blood test results, DXA scan reports, or any relevant documents. It provides a timeline of significant nutrition-related events or changes.

Player Profiles not only store data but also present it in a meaningful way. The UI will highlight important info such as **current vs. target weight**, or an alert if an athlete has an allergy, ensuring dietitians notice critical factors when planning. A robust profile sets the stage for the AI to make appropriate recommendations (e.g. it will _know_ if an athlete is vegan or if they are in heavy training week) and for the staff to have all context in one place. This comprehensive view mirrors best practices observed in platforms like Notemeal and Nutritics, where dietitians can view anthropometric data and adjust plans accordingly. By centralising profile data, the system ensures that nutrition planning is always informed by the athlete’s unique context.

### **3\. AI-Assisted Planning and Insights**

This module is the core differentiator of our product – it harnesses artificial intelligence to assist in creating nutrition plans and extracting performance insights. **AI-Assisted Planning** refers to using algorithms (from simple rule-based calculations to advanced machine learning) to generate and suggest meal plans, hydration strategies, and other nutritional interventions tailored to each athlete. Based on the data in a player’s profile (biometrics, dietary needs, training load, goals), the system’s AI can automatically propose daily meal schedules with recommended foods and portions. For example, if an athlete has a heavy training day with two sessions, the AI might suggest an increased carbohydrate intake split into specific pre- and post-exercise meals to optimise recovery. All suggestions will be aligned with evidence-based sports nutrition guidelines and any custom parameters set by the dietitian.

Key features of AI-assisted planning include:

- **Automated Meal Plan Generation:** The system can draft meal plans for a given day or week at the click of a button, personalising each plan to the athlete’s needs (calories, macros) and schedule. This echoes the approach of ZoneIn, which provides _automated meal plans personalised to each athlete’s unique body needs, training schedule, and goals_. Dietitians remain in control – they can review and tweak AI-generated plans before approving them – but the heavy lifting of initial plan creation is done in seconds, not hours.

- **Nutrient Analysis and Targets:** As plans are created (either AI-generated or manually by the dietitian), the system displays real-time nutrient summaries (calories, macros, and selected micronutrients) against the athlete’s targets. It will flag discrepancies (e.g. plan is 20g protein short of target) so adjustments can be made.

- **AI Insights & Recommendations:** Beyond planning meals, the AI will continuously analyse available data to offer insights. For instance, it might highlight that an athlete’s iron intake has been below recommended levels for the past month, or suggest hydration reminders during a heatwave. It could also learn from aggregated data (anonymised) and best practices – akin to how Notemeal leveraged data from dozens of dietitians to inform its meal plan suggestions. These insights are presented to the dietitian as alerts or dashboard widgets, helping catch issues that might otherwise be overlooked.

- **Scenario Planning (“What-If” analysis):** The dietitian could use the AI to simulate changes – e.g. _“What if this athlete goes vegetarian?”_ or _“What adjustments are needed if next week’s training load increases by 20%?”_. The system can then suggest modified plans or highlight the nutritional gaps to fill in each scenario, serving as a decision support tool for forward planning.

- **Personalised Education for Athletes:** The AI module can also generate simple explanations or tips that accompany the meal plans, so athletes understand _why_ certain foods or timings are suggested. For example, a note might read: “Including oily fish this evening to boost omega-3 intake for inflammation management.” These can help athletes buy into the plan and learn, without the dietitian having to manually write out rationale each time.

Importantly, AI assistance is always paired with professional oversight. The dietitian can accept, modify, or reject AI suggestions. This _human-in-the-loop_ approach ensures that nuanced context (like an athlete’s food preferences on a given day or last-minute schedule changes) are accounted for. The goal is to **save time and extend the dietitian’s reach**, not to replace their expertise. By automating repetitive calculations and leveraging vast nutritional data, the system gives practitioners more time to focus on personal interaction and higher-level strategy. Athletes, in turn, receive timely, precise guidance – for example, each athlete can have a truly personalised daily nutrition gameplan delivered to their device.

The AI-assisted module will also support **insights at team level**. Trends such as average macronutrient intake of the team, or flagging which athletes are at risk of low energy availability, can be generated by the system. In future integrations, combining nutrition data with workload data could allow monitoring of energy balance and recovery status across the squad. Even in MVP, dietitians can get value from AI by identifying, say, the top 5 athletes who may need weight gain support or the ones who haven’t been logging meals (if that’s part of the workflow). Overall, this module ensures the product not only acts as a planning tool but also as an **analytical assistant**, turning data into actionable knowledge.

### **4\. Collaboration Tools and Permissions**

Nutrition in a team setting is inherently collaborative. This module provides the features that enable seamless communication, sharing, and role-appropriate access within the platform. **Collaboration Tools** include messaging and commenting functionalities, notifications, and content sharing mechanisms that connect dietitians, athletes, and other performance staff. For example, a dietitian can use the platform to send a quick message to an athlete (“Please remember to log your breakfast today” or “How did you feel about this week’s meal plan?”), or conversely an athlete could ask a question (“Can I swap almonds for walnuts in my snack?”). These messages can live within the player’s profile or a dedicated chat interface, ensuring context is preserved and avoiding the need for external messaging apps.

Additionally, the platform will support sharing of resources – a dietitian might upload recipes, educational infographics, or links (e.g. a hydration guideline PDF) to a common library or directly to specific player profiles. Athletes can access these resources on their own, empowering them with knowledge outside of face-to-face meeting time. In a team scenario, announcements or group messages (like “Team dinner moved to 6pm, adjust afternoon snack timing accordingly”) can be broadcast by staff to all relevant athletes via the app.

**Permissions:** Underpinning collaboration is a robust permissions system (role-based access control) that ensures each user sees and does only what they are authorised to. For instance, athletes will only see their own plan and data (not other players’ data), whereas a dietitian or coach can see all players under their care. The module will allow role-specific views and actions. A coach might have permission to view players’ nutrition status and comment, but not to edit the nutrition plans. A head dietitian might have full access to modify any plan, while an intern or assistant might have read-only or proposal rights. These granular permissions prevent accidental or unauthorised changes and protect sensitive information (such as an athlete’s medical details).

**Team Collaboration:** The platform recognises that performance nutrition is part of a bigger ecosystem. As such, it will facilitate collaboration not just between dietitian and athlete, but also with other stakeholders like strength & conditioning coaches, team doctors, or even chefs when applicable. For MVP, this might be limited to giving those stakeholders appropriate view access or the ability to comment on plans. (E.g. a strength coach might leave a note: “We’ve added an extra lifting session on Tuesday – please ensure nutrition accounts for that.”) This integrated communication ensures everyone is on the same page regarding an athlete’s programme. Future versions might include dedicated interfaces for chefs or food service (as seen in competitor systems where kitchen staff get meal orders directly), but in the MVP, any such coordination would be done through the dietitian’s use of the app (e.g. exporting a meal plan to share with catering via email).

In summary, the Collaboration and Permissions module enables the web app to function as a secure, central hub for all nutrition-related communications and teamwork. By replacing scattered texts, emails, and spreadsheets with an integrated solution, it fosters efficiency and clarity. Everyone from the athlete up to the head of performance can work together within the platform, with the confidence that **data is protected and relevant stakeholders are informed**.

## **Functional Requirements for Each Module**

This section details the functional requirements corresponding to each of the core modules described above. These requirements define what the system **must do** in the MVP. They are organised by module for clarity, though some features (e.g. search or data export) may span multiple modules.

### **A. Player Management – Functional Requirements**

- **Player Creation & Import:** The system shall allow authorised staff to create new player profiles with basic details (name, DOB, etc.) and initialise them in the database. Bulk import of players (via CSV template upload) shall be supported to onboard whole teams efficiently.

- **Team/Group Organisation:** The system shall support organising players into teams, sub-teams, or custom groups. Users can assign one or multiple team affiliations to a player (for example, “U18 Academy” and “Senior Squad” if an athlete floats between teams). It shall be possible to view and manage players by team or group lists.

- **Player Listing & Search:** Users shall be able to view a roster list of all players they have access to, with key info (e.g. position, team, flags for any alerts). A search bar shall enable filtering this list by name or other attributes (team, position, tag). For instance, typing “injury” could filter to players tagged with an injury status.

- **Profile Status Management:** The system shall allow marking a player profile as active/inactive or archived. Inactive could represent an athlete who has left the organisation or is temporarily not under guidance. These profiles should be hidden from default views but retain their data for record-keeping.

- **Batch Actions:** The platform should provide batch operation capability for efficiency. For example, a dietitian could select multiple players and assign them all the same base meal plan or send them all a common message. (This ties into collaboration features but is initiated from the player list context.)

- **Data Import/Export:** It shall be possible to export player lists and basic data to a file (e.g. CSV or Excel) for external use. Likewise, basic integration hooks or import functions should exist so that, in future, players can be synced from an external athlete management system (though this is not automated in MVP).

**Rationale:** These requirements ensure that the platform can handle real-world team scenarios where managing dozens or hundreds of athletes at once is necessary. Efficient player management saves time and reduces errors when dealing with large squads. (Notably, competitors emphasise scalability – e.g. ZoneIn’s ability to handle 10,000+ athletes across organisations – so our system’s foundation must be solid in this regard.)

### **B. Player Profiles – Functional Requirements**

- **Comprehensive Profile Fields:** Each player profile shall include fields for personal, anthropometric, medical, and performance data as outlined in the module description. This includes but is not limited to: height, weight (with history tracking), body fat %, dietary preferences (omnivore/vegetarian/vegan, etc.), allergies, chronic conditions, injury status, supplementation use, typical daily schedule, and personal goals. All fields should be editable by authorised staff.

- **Goal & Requirement Calculations:** The system shall provide a tool or form within the profile for dietitians to calculate an athlete’s nutritional requirements (total daily energy expenditure and macro needs) based on profile data. For example, inputting training hours per week or activity factors could auto-calculate calorie needs. The dietitian can adjust these or input custom targets. These targets (calories, macros, key micros) are then stored in the profile and used by the planning module.

- **Progress Tracking:** Profiles shall visually display progress for key metrics over time. For example, a weight chart over the last 6 months, or a calorie intake vs goal trend if the athlete is logging intake. The system must store historical data points (e.g. past weigh-ins, body comp results) and allow charting them. This helps dietitians and coaches see trends at a glance.

- **Alerts/Flags in Profile:** If any profile data is outside normal ranges or requires attention, the system shall flag it. For instance, an allergy flag should be highly visible. If an athlete’s current weight is 5% below their target, perhaps an alert is shown. These rules can be configured by the dietitian (e.g. set a flag if weight drops \>X% or if BMI below threshold). This ensures critical information isn’t overlooked when viewing the profile.

- **Profile Attachments & Notes:** The system shall allow uploading attachments to a profile (PDFs, images, etc., such as blood test results, nutrition plans in PDF, or a doctor’s note). It shall also support free-form notes/journal entries by staff to record any qualitative observations or meeting summaries. A timestamp and author should be recorded for each note for auditing.

- **Privacy Controls for Sensitive Data:** Certain fields (especially medical details) may be marked as sensitive and visible only to certain roles (e.g. a dietitian or physician, but not a coach). The system needs to enforce these visibility settings as part of access control (for instance, a coach role might see that an athlete has a medical issue but not see detailed notes on it). This ties into the permissions model described later.

**Rationale:** These requirements make the player profile a one-stop shop for athlete information. Competing solutions highlight the importance of rich profiles – e.g., Notemeal allows dietitians to view anthropometrics and even build meal plans from that context. By capturing all relevant data and keeping it up-to-date, our platform ensures the AI has quality input and that any human user has the full picture before making decisions. Moreover, implementing robust tracking and alerts supports proactive management (dietitians can intervene early if something is off-track).

### **C. AI-Assisted Planning and Insights – Functional Requirements**

- **Meal Plan Generation (AI):** The system shall provide functionality to generate meal plans using AI algorithms. A user (dietitian) can initiate an “AI Plan” for a selected athlete over a specified period (e.g. “generate next 7 days”). The AI should use the athlete’s profile data (targets, preferences, schedule) to create a detailed plan including meal times, suggested food items or recipes, and portion sizes. The generated plan must respect constraints (e.g. no meat if vegetarian, avoid allergens) and aim to meet the nutritional targets. Dietitians can then review and modify this plan before saving or publishing it to the athlete.

- **Plan Editing & Versioning:** Users must be able to manually edit any AI-generated plan or create one from scratch. The system will support an interactive meal planning interface (e.g. drag-and-drop foods or select from a database). It should show running totals of nutrients vs goals as edits are made. The platform shall keep track of versions or changes – for example, if an AI plan is modified, it could keep the original in history or mark which parts were AI-suggested vs. edited. This helps with accountability and learning (the AI could learn from adjustments over time).

- **Food Database Integration:** To support planning, the system shall include a comprehensive food composition database (or integrate an external one) covering common foods, sport-specific products (like popular sports drinks, recovery shakes), and the ability for dietitians to add custom foods/recipes. Each food item in the database has nutritional info (calories, macros, vitamins/minerals). The AI will draw on this database when constructing meal plans (e.g. picking from known foods). This database should ideally support UK and US food items and units (imperial and metric).

- **Nutrient and Allergen Tracking:** The planning module must automatically calculate the full nutrient profile of a given plan and check for any allergens or banned substances (if supplement data is included). For MVP, banned substance checking (like NSF certified supplements) might be a future consideration, but at minimum the system should alert if a suggested item contains a tagged allergen from the athlete’s profile.

- **AI Insight Generation:** The system shall continuously or periodically generate insights based on nutrition data. Examples: identify if an athlete is consistently under-consuming protein; highlight that an athlete’s hydration logs (if intake logging is present) are below recommended levels on high-heat days; or suggest foods rich in a vitamin if the athlete’s recent intake was low. These insights/alerts will be displayed on the dashboard or the respective player’s profile as actionable notifications.

- **Interactive AI Assistant (Conversational):** (Stretch goal for MVP, but a defining AI-first feature) The platform should offer a conversational AI assistant interface where users can ask questions or request actions. For example, a dietitian might type or speak, “Create a high-carb meal plan for John for the day before his marathon,” and the system would draft that plan. Or an athlete might ask, “What can I eat for a snack that’s high in protein but under 200 kcal?” and get an immediate suggestion, constrained by their dietary profile. This feature, if not fully realised in MVP, is planned for future, but initial groundwork (NLP capabilities) should be laid. It aligns with modern AI-first design and is inspired by existing nutrition apps that incorporate AI assistants (for instance, Nutritics’ Libro app includes an AI-powered voice assistant for logging and suggestions).

- **Plan Delivery & Notifications:** Once a meal plan is finalised for an athlete, the system shall have the capability to “publish” it to the athlete’s view and optionally send a notification (email or SMS) that a new plan is available. As noted in the USOPC example, a dietitian could trigger a notification like “A new meal has been created for you” so athletes promptly check their plans. For MVP this might be via email or simple push if a mobile-web push is possible; in the future, native mobile apps would handle push notifications.

- **Shopping List and Recipe Outputs:** The system shall be able to generate a **shopping list** from a meal plan, listing ingredients needed for the period of the plan (useful for athletes who buy/prepare their own food). Moreover, if the meal plan includes recipes (e.g. “chicken pasta bake”), the system can provide the recipe instructions or links. Ideally, AI can assist by consolidating a shopping list and even tailoring recipes to preferences. In fact, Notemeal’s AI features include designing personalised shopping lists and recipes automatically, which is a benchmark we strive to meet or exceed in our product. While the MVP will have a basic version of this (e.g. manual export of ingredients), the architecture will support full AI-driven automation of recipe handling as a priority feature.

- **Team-Wide Planning:** The system shall support templates or duplicated plans that can be applied to multiple athletes with one action (useful for team meal events or common needs). For example, a “gameday meal plan” template could be created and then assigned to all players in the starting lineup, automatically adjusting portions to each player’s needs. This combines AI with grouping logic from Player Management to save time on repetitive planning tasks.

**Rationale:** These requirements ensure the platform delivers on its promise of AI-driven efficiency and personalisation. The inclusion of a large food database and nutrient analysis is non-negotiable for a nutrition app – dietitians expect accurate data at their fingertips (Nutritics, for instance, touts comprehensive food reference databases and recipe analysis tools). The ability to auto-generate plans and shopping lists addresses real pain points: dietitians spend hours writing plans and athletes often need guidance to implement them, so features that cut those hours down and directly support the athlete (like grocery lists) are hugely valuable. By specifying both the automated and manual capabilities, we make clear that the system is flexible and dietitian-controlled, which will aid adoption and trust in the AI recommendations.

### **D. Collaboration Tools and Permissions – Functional Requirements**

- **User Messaging System:** The platform shall include an internal messaging system enabling direct communication between users (dietitian ↔ athlete, dietitian ↔ coach, etc.). At minimum, a dietitian can send a private message to an individual athlete or to a group (like an entire team). Athletes can reply, but for MVP athletes might be restricted to messaging their dietitians/coaches, not other athletes (to keep focus on professional guidance). Messages should support basic text and possibly attachments (like a photo of a meal, which athletes might send to get feedback). Notifications (email or in-app) should alert users to new messages.

- **Comments on Plans/Entries:** The system shall allow commenting in context – for example, a dietitian can leave a comment on a specific meal in an athlete’s plan (“Try to have this 30 min after training for best effect”). Athletes can also comment or mark a meal as eaten/not eaten, which serves as feedback. Coaches or other authorised staff could comment as well (e.g. S\&C coach commenting on pre-match meal timing). These comments should be visible to all who have access to that plan, creating a discussion thread linked to the plan.

- **Resource Sharing:** The platform shall provide a section or library for resources (documents, videos, links). Dietitians (or admins) can upload resources and decide if they are shared globally (to all athletes in the club) or to specific groups/individuals. For example, an academy might upload a “Nutrition Handbook PDF” accessible to all their athletes, or a recipe book just for the rugby team. Athletes can download or view these within the app.

- **Scheduling & Calendar Integration:** (Basic in MVP) The system should incorporate a calendar view where team events or key dates are shown. A dietitian might input that there’s a team training camp from June 1-7, or a match on a certain date, and potentially tag nutrition plans around those events. While full integration with external calendars is future (and Notemeal is known to integrate training schedules into its planning), MVP can offer at least a simple calendar to help align nutrition plans with events. This calendar could be viewable by athletes for their schedule awareness.

- **Role-Based Access Control:** The system must implement roles with predefined permission sets: e.g. **Administrator**, **Dietitian/Nutritionist**, **Coach**, **Athlete**, (and possibly **Analyst** or **Assistant** roles as needed). Each role will have specific rights:
  - Dietitians can create/edit all nutrition data for players in their organisation;

  - Coaches perhaps can view all players and their plans, but only comment, not edit plans;

  - Athletes can view only their own profile and plans, log their own data, and communicate with staff;

  - Admins (or Club Managers) can manage user accounts, club settings, and see all data within their club.  
     The system should enforce these permissions at every functional point (e.g. an athlete trying to access another athlete’s ID should be denied; a coach trying to edit a plan might see a read-only interface).

- **Multi-Organisation Access:** If a user (say a dietitian or coach) is involved with multiple organisations (clubs), the system shall allow that single user account to switch context between those clubs securely. They will only see data for the active club they’ve switched to. This avoids the need for multiple logins and supports use cases like a consultant dietitian advising two universities, or an athlete who transfers – though an athlete’s data would not automatically transfer between orgs without explicit action for data protection. (More details in the next section on authorisation model.)

- **Audit Logging:** Every collaborative action (messages sent, comments added, plan edited, etc.) shall be logged with user, time, and action details. This is important not only for security audit but also for collaboration transparency – e.g. if a coach edited something or a note was added by an intern, others can see who did it. MVP will log these events in the backend; exposing a full audit trail UI might be a future enhancement, but the data will be collected from day one.

**Rationale:** These requirements ensure that the platform truly becomes a collaborative workspace rather than just a static database. Nutrition is most effective when it’s interactive; for example, athletes who log meals or communicate regularly with dietitians tend to have better compliance. By building in messaging and commenting, we keep those interactions in-app, tied to the data (unlike WhatsApp or email which are separate). Role-based controls are critical in a multi-user environment for confidentiality and data integrity – they prevent mistakes like a coach accidentally changing a meal plan, and protect athlete privacy. Competitors in this space highlight the importance of connectivity: Teamworks Nutrition (Notemeal) markets itself on connecting athletes, dietitians, and kitchens seamlessly. While our MVP won’t have a dedicated kitchen module, our collaboration features and solid permission structure lay the groundwork for eventually looping in all stakeholders (including perhaps chefs or caterers in future phases). The built-in audit logging also aligns with enterprise expectations for accountability, especially in institutional settings.

## **Non-Functional Requirements**

Aside from the core functionality, the product must meet a number of non-functional requirements that ensure it is secure, reliable, and user-friendly in a professional sports context. These include:

- **Security & Privacy:** All data, especially personal and health-related information about athletes, must be stored and transmitted securely. The app shall use encryption in transit (HTTPS) and at rest for sensitive data. Role-based access (as described) is a key security aspect, ensuring users can only access data they should. We will comply with data protection regulations applicable to our users – for UK users, GDPR compliance is required; for US NCAA, while not strictly medical records, we will treat nutrition data with HIPAA-like care as a best practice. User authentication will require strong passwords, and session management will be robust (automatic timeouts, etc.). In the closed beta, user accounts will likely be created by an admin (no open sign-up to maintain a controlled user base). The system should also include consent mechanisms if any athlete data is to be used for AI training or research (transparency that data might be used in aggregate to improve recommendations).

- **Logging and Auditability:** The platform shall maintain comprehensive logs of user activities. This includes logins, data entry/modification events, plan generation actions, and data exports. These logs should be timestamped and stored securely for audit purposes. In a team environment, this traceability is important if questions arise (e.g. “who updated this player’s weight entry?”). Logging also assists in debugging and improving the system (especially the AI suggestions – logging when the AI was used and what it output can help developers refine the algorithms). For MVP, logs will be accessible to the development/admin team; in future, an admin user at an organisation might have access to some audit logs as well.

- **Performance and Scalability:** The application should perform smoothly with the expected beta user load (which might be on the order of a few organisations, each with perhaps dozens of staff and hundreds of athletes). Page loads for key views (rosters, profiles) should typically complete within 2 seconds on a standard broadband connection. The AI meal plan generation, being a heavier operation, should ideally return a result within, say, 5-10 seconds at most, so as not to keep users waiting too long (this might depend on model complexity, so we’ll monitor and optimise accordingly). The system architecture shall be built on scalable cloud infrastructure so that if we onboard more organisations or move to open launch, we can scale horizontally (e.g. adding more server instances, scaling the database) without a redesign. We target high availability; while beta might not have a formal SLA, the system should strive for \>99% uptime and any maintenance downtimes will be communicated.

- **Usability and Responsiveness:** The UI/UX should follow modern, intuitive design principles, catering to both tech-savvy and non-technical users (some dietitians may not be very tech-oriented, so the interface must be clean and not over-complicated). We aim for a responsive web design so that the platform can be used not only on desktop browsers but also on tablets and mobile devices. Athletes, especially, are likely to check plans on their phones. Thus, key athlete-facing pages (their daily plan view, logging interface) must render nicely on a smartphone screen. While a native mobile app is out-of-scope for MVP, the web app should be touch-friendly and tested on common mobile browsers. Consistent navigation, clear feedback on actions, and the ability to undo or confirm critical actions (like deleting a profile or publishing a plan) are all important for usability. In user testing, we will specifically gather feedback from both UK and US users to ensure the terminology and units (metric/imperial) are appropriately localised.

- **Data Integrity and Consistency:** The system must maintain accurate and consistent data. Concurrent edits (e.g. two staff editing the same profile) should be handled gracefully (either through locking or real-time collaboration features to be possibly introduced later). All calculations (like nutrient totals, requirement computations) must be scientifically sound and double-checked for accuracy using accepted formulas and data sources. We should also ensure consistency of units (for example, if a dietitian enters weight in kilograms vs pounds, the system should store and display it consistently per user preference or organisation settings).

- **Maintainability & Extensibility:** Though end-users won’t directly see this, it’s crucial that the system is built in a modular way (mirroring the product modules) to allow future enhancements. For instance, adding an integration with a wearable’s API or a new AI algorithm for recipe suggestions should be possible without massive refactoring. The codebase and architecture should follow best practices so that new developers or team members can easily contribute. Configuration (like adding a new role or toggling a feature flag) should not require code changes ideally. This will facilitate the phased roadmap execution.

- **Compliance and Standards:** If there are relevant standards (for example, if we eventually deal with dietary supplements in the US, we might heed NCAA regulations on permissible supplements; or ISO standards for software security), the product should be built to not preclude meeting those. At MVP, a key compliance is with privacy laws and ensuring any nutritional advice given by AI is within safe and evidence-based bounds (we must avoid liability – e.g. the AI shouldn’t prescribe anything dangerous; hence why dietitian approval is needed for AI plans).

In essence, these non-functional requirements ensure the platform is **trusted, reliable, and professional-grade**. Elite sports organisations will expect nothing less – the tool must not compromise their data or waste their time with slowness or crashes. By adhering to these standards, we position the product as enterprise-ready, even at the MVP stage, which will build confidence among our beta users and pave the way for broader adoption.

## **Role-Based Access and Multi-Club Authorisation Model**

A robust role-based access control (RBAC) system underpins the platform’s security and multi-user collaboration. Below are the primary user roles envisaged for the system and their respective permissions:

| Role                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Key Permissions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Organisation Admin**      | Typically the head of performance or IT admin at a club. Manages organisation settings and user accounts. There can be more than one admin per club.                                                               | \- Invite and remove users (staff or athletes) in their organisation.- Configure org-level settings (e.g. branding, unit preferences).- Full read/write access to all data in that organisation (can view all player profiles, edit plans, etc., though in practice they may leave nutrition specifics to dietitians).- Can assign roles to users within the org.                                                                                                                              |
| **Dietitian/Nutritionist**  | A professional responsible for players’ nutrition. This is the primary power-user of the system.                                                                                                                   | \- Full access to all player profiles and nutrition data for their organisation.- Create/edit/delete meal plans, profiles, and notes for any athlete in their org.- Initiate AI plan generation and adjust AI settings.- View and respond to athlete logs and messages.- (If multiple dietitians in one org, they all have similar access; in future, we might allow segmenting by team, but MVP assumes trust among staff in one org.)                                                        |
| **Coach/Performance Staff** | This can include strength & conditioning coaches, team coaches, or medical staff who need visibility but not editing rights to nutrition info. They support the athlete but are not the primary nutrition planner. | \- View access to player profiles (possibly a limited subset of info if marked private by dietitian).- View meal plans for athletes (to coordinate training with nutrition).- Add comments or suggestions on plans or in athlete notes (e.g. a coach can comment “player X seemed low energy today”).- Cannot directly edit meal plans or core profile data.- Can message dietitians or athletes through the platform.                                                                         |
| **Athlete**                 | The end-user athlete whose nutrition is being managed.                                                                                                                                                             | \- View their own profile data and meal plans as published by staff.- Log daily food intake or compliance against the plan (if logging feature is used).- Communicate with their dietitian (and possibly coaches) via messaging/commenting.- Edit limited fields in their profile if allowed (maybe they can update something like their own daily wellness feedback or meal log, but not change their targets).- No visibility of other athletes’ data; no access to administrative features. |
| **(Future) Chef/Catering**  | _Not in MVP._ For future consideration if integrating with kitchen meal ordering.                                                                                                                                  | _Would have access to view meal plans or menu requests for multiple athletes, export ingredient lists, etc._ Not applicable in MVP since no direct kitchen module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

**Multi-Club Authorisation Model:** The platform will support a scenario where users may be associated with multiple organisations (clubs/institutions) simultaneously. This is important for consultants or staff changing jobs, and for oversight roles. The model works as follows:

- Each user account is tied to one or more organisations, with a distinct role in each. For example, John Doe could be a **Dietitian** in “University A” and also a **Dietitian** in “Club B” under the same login, if he consults for both. Or an athlete who moves from Club A to Club B could have access to both for a transitional period (though typically their old club access would be removed when they leave).

- Users with multi-organisation ties will have a simple way in the UI to switch active organisation context (e.g. a drop-down menu to select which org’s data they are currently viewing). Once switched, all data and actions pertain to that organisation. This prevents any inadvertent cross-over of information.

- Data segregation is strictly enforced: an organisation’s data (player profiles, plans, etc.) is not visible to users when they are in another organisation’s context, even if they have roles in both. There is no blending of data across orgs at the database level – each org’s data is essentially siloed, with cross-org access only possible by changing context which is effectively like logging into a separate space.

- A user’s roles can differ per org. E.g., someone could be an Admin in one org and a Coach in another, depending on their job function in each context. The system will apply the correct permissions based on the current org context.

- **Authorisation Management:** Organisation Admins can only manage users within their own org (they can invite someone by email to their org, at which point if that person already has an account, they gain a new role under the inviting org). The platform’s super-admin (our product team) can oversee all for support but that’s outside of normal use.

- When it comes to an athlete moving clubs: currently, their profile does not automatically migrate due to privacy (Club A wouldn’t share all data with Club B without consent). If an athlete wants their data ported, a data export/import could be done by the dietitians in coordination (future could allow athlete-controlled data portability). For MVP, we assume each org manages its own copy of player data.

This multi-club support reflects real-world needs, as dietitians in say, the UK might work part-time at a club and part-time for a national team, or NCAA staff might oversee multiple sports teams (each could be modelled as separate “organisations” or a single org with teams – in our model we might actually treat a single university as one organisation with many teams, which is simpler). We use the term “organisation” broadly to cover a club, university, academy, or any entity that has its own silo of data.

**Example:** Sarah is the head dietitian for an Academy that has partnered with a University. She has an Organisation Admin role at “Elite Academy” and a Dietitian role at “State University Athletics”. Using the app, she can switch between the two contexts to manage each group of athletes separately. When in Academy mode, she sees only academy players and data; when she switches to University, she sees the NCAA athletes. This flexibility eliminates the need for separate logins and streamlines her workflow, while maintaining strict data separation for privacy and organisational integrity.

In summary, the RBAC and multi-org model ensures that the right people have the right access to the right data, and that our platform can serve complex use cases (like multi-team oversight) out of the box. It is a significant selling point for institutions that collaborate or for professionals who serve multiple client organisations.

## **MVP Scope and Phased Development Roadmap**

The development will be phased to deliver immediate value with the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and then build on it with additional features and integrations. Below is the roadmap outlining the MVP scope and future phases:

### **Phase 1: MVP (Closed Beta)**

**Timeline:** Targeting an initial beta release (e.g. to select partners in Q3 2025).  
 **Scope:** The MVP will include all core modules and essential features described above, focused on a standalone web application for nutrition management. Key deliverables in MVP:

- Basic Player Management: create/manage player profiles, team grouping, search, and import/export.

- Complete Player Profile pages with all relevant fields and manual data entry; basic progress charts for weight.

- AI-Assisted Planning (v1): AI meal plan generation for individual athletes with manual editing; nutrient analysis; limited AI insights (e.g. simple alerts on macro targets). AI model likely based on rules \+ initial machine learning, tested with dietitian input.

- Food Database: integration of a standard food composition dataset (e.g. USDA and/or UK McCance data) to support meal planning and nutrient calcs.

- Collaboration: in-app messaging between dietitian and athletes; commenting on plans; ability to share resources (file upload/download).

- Role/Permission system: Admin, Dietitian, Coach, Athlete roles implemented as specified; multi-org switching implemented in the UI for test users who need it.

- Non-functional foundations: secure deployment, audit logging in place, responsive UI tested on common devices.

**Out of Scope for MVP:** Native mobile apps (web only access), wearable or third-party integrations, advanced AI features like conversational assistant (MVP AI is primarily for plan generation, not free-form Q\&A), multi-language support, and any e-commerce/payments. Also, kitchen/staff-specific modules (like meal ordering) are not in MVP.

**Deployment:** Closed beta means the app is not publicly available; users are invited. No payments are handled as the service is free during beta. Support will be provided closely to beta users, and their feedback will shape immediate improvements.

### **Phase 2: Expanded Beta and Feature Enhancements**

**Timeline:** \~3-6 months after MVP, depending on feedback (e.g. Q1 2026 for a wider beta).  
 **Scope:** This phase focuses on enhancing the MVP based on user feedback and adding high-priority features that didn’t make the initial cut. Potential enhancements in this phase:

- **Mobile Accessibility:** Launch of companion native mobile apps for athletes (and possibly staff) _or_ significant optimisation of the web app for mobile use. This will improve athlete engagement as they can more easily log meals or check plans on the go.

- **Wearable/Training Data Integration (initial):** If there is demand, integrate with one or two popular platforms (for example, pull in step counts or training load from Fitbit/Apple Health or an athlete management system). Even a simple integration to get daily energy expenditure estimates could greatly enhance the AI’s recommendations (enabling features like energy availability tracking as seen with Notemeal-Smartabase integration).

- **Advanced AI Features:** Introduce the conversational AI assistant to answer nutrition questions or do quick tasks via chat interface. Improve the AI’s personalisation by incorporating more data (feedback loops from what plans were accepted or edited by dietitians). Also expand AI-driven insights, possibly implementing predictive analytics (e.g. flagging if an athlete might be at risk of not meeting a goal based on current trend).

- **Team dashboards:** New analytics dashboards for coaches and admins. For example, a summary of team nutrition status, showing how many athletes are on track, or average macro distribution across the team. This gives higher-level value to performance directors.

- **Quality of Life improvements:** e.g. template libraries for meal plans (some pre-built plans or recipes available to dietitians), more robust calendar integration (import training schedules if available), and refined UI based on MVP user suggestions.

- **Security/Compliance:** If needed for larger user base, enhancements like SSO (single sign-on) for organisations, more granular privacy settings, and preparing compliance documents (e.g. if pursuing HIPAA compliance formally, etc., in this timeframe).

Phase 2 will likely still be under a “beta” label but opened to more organisations, potentially including some paying pilot customers. The aim is to solidify the product-market fit and reliability with these improvements before a general launch.

### **Phase 3: General Availability (GA) and Growth Features**

**Timeline:** \~6-12 months after Phase 2 (late 2026 perhaps).  
 **Scope:** At this stage, the product should be ready for a wider market release with robust features. Focus areas:

- **Integration Ecosystem:** Build out API integrations with major athlete management systems (e.g. Teamworks, Smartabase) to import/export data seamlessly. Also integrate with nutrition databases or services (maybe pull recipe content from providers, or integrate a barcode scanner feature via a mobile app for easy logging like Nutritics’ Libro does). Possibly connect with kitchen ordering systems or create our own module for that, enabling dietitians to send meal orders to team kitchen or track buffet offerings vs. athlete choices.

- **Multi-Language and Localisation:** To expand beyond UK/US, add support for multiple languages and regional food databases. This might coincide with targeting new markets (e.g. European clubs in non-English speaking countries).

- **Monetisation & Admin Tools:** Implement subscription management, billing features as needed for a SaaS offering. Also, develop organisational admin dashboards for usage metrics, user management improvements (e.g. bulk invite athletes via email), and possibly tiered service levels.

- **AI Evolution:** Continue to refine the AI models with more data. Possibly incorporate machine learning on anonymised datasets of food logs to better predict and suggest interventions. Investigate emerging AI tech (like more advanced LLMs or computer vision to allow photo-based food logging in the app). Ensure AI decisions are transparent and trustworthy – maybe an “AI recommendation explanation” feature so dietitians see why something was suggested (important for trust).

- **Outcome Tracking:** Add features to track outcomes linked to nutrition – injuries, performance stats, etc., to start correlating nutrition plans with performance (long-term value add, making the app not just about input (food) but also linking to output (performance metrics)). This can differentiate us by showing ROI of nutrition interventions.

At GA, the product should cover the breadth of functionality that competitors offer, and exceed them particularly in AI capabilities and user experience. It will be a comprehensive platform for performance nutrition management, ready for wide deployment across pro teams, colleges, and academies.

Each phase will be revisited based on user feedback and evolving industry standards. For example, if a new important need arises (say, mental health and nutrition integration) we may adjust priorities. The roadmap above is a living guide, ensuring we deliver value iteratively: first solving the core problems (MVP), then delighting users with efficiency boosters (Phase 2), and finally scaling and innovating further (Phase 3 and beyond).

## **Success Metrics**

To gauge the success of the product – especially during and after the MVP beta – we will track a variety of metrics. These metrics will help us understand adoption, engagement, and the impact on the workflow for sports nutrition staff and athletes. Key success metrics include:

- **User Adoption and Engagement:** Number of active organisations, and within those, the percentage of staff and athletes regularly using the platform. For example, we’ll look at **DAUs/WAUs (Daily/Weekly Active Users)** among dietitians and athletes. A successful outcome would be, say, \>80% of invited athletes logging in weekly to check plans or log meals, and dietitians using the platform daily. High adoption indicates the tool is delivering value and becoming embedded in routines.

- **Time Savings for Dietitians:** Through user feedback and possibly time-tracking studies, measure how much time is spent on meal planning and administrative tasks before vs. after using the platform. Our hypothesis is that AI-assisted planning will significantly cut down plan creation time (e.g. from 2 hours per athlete per week to 30 minutes or less). If dietitians report that they can handle more athletes or spend more time on direct coaching because of our tool, that’s a key success indicator.

- **Plan Quality and Personalisation:** Although harder to quantify directly, we might track metrics like **average macro alignment** of plans to targets (the closer plans meet 100% of each athlete’s needs, the better). If our AI routinely produces plans that require minimal edits (perhaps track the edit rate: what % of AI meal suggestions are accepted vs modified by the dietitian), that implies the AI is effectively capturing the personalised needs. Positive feedback from dietitians on plan quality also serves as a qualitative metric.

- **Athlete Compliance & Outcomes:** Using app data, measure athlete compliance with logging or plan adherence. For instance, if the app has a meal logging feature, what percentage of meals are logged by athletes? Do athletes meet their calorie/protein targets more consistently over time? Higher compliance would suggest the app is engaging athletes well. We can also gather self-reported outcomes: e.g. number of athletes reaching their weight or performance goals in a season, though many factors influence that, a trend of improvements under the app’s guidance would be a great validation.

- **Collaboration Activity:** Monitor usage of messaging and commenting features. Metrics like number of messages sent per week, or average comments per meal plan, can indicate how integrated the platform is in daily communication. If we see coaches and athletes actively interacting on the platform (versus outside texting), that’s a sign of centralised communication success.

- **Retention and Expansion:** For the beta, track **organisation retention** – do the teams who start using the beta continue to use it throughout the season? Are they eager to continue into a paid version? Also, track if usage expands within an organisation (e.g. one team’s success leads to another team in the same club adopting it – a good sign). Post-MVP, a low churn rate and positive word-of-mouth (referrals) will be important metrics.

- **User Satisfaction:** Collect qualitative metrics through surveys (post-beta NPS score, or simply asking dietitians “how likely are you to recommend this to colleagues?”). We aim for high satisfaction particularly from the dietitian users; an NPS in the positive range (\> 0, ideally \+50 or more given a niche B2B product) would indicate strong product-market fit. Also monitor specific feedback on AI features – do users trust and like the AI suggestions? That trust is a metric in itself, possibly measured through surveys or usage (if they keep using the AI planning repeatedly, it implies trust).

- **Data Accuracy and Issue Rates:** Track any errors or issues, e.g. frequency of support tickets, any incidents of incorrect data or AI giving a wrong suggestion. A high success rate would mean few to no critical errors reported in nutrition calculations or app stability. This is more of a quality metric, ensuring the product is reliable (which indirectly affects user satisfaction and adoption).

During the closed beta, success will be defined more by engagement and feedback than revenue (since it’s free at that stage). We’ll set specific targets such as: e.g. “At least 5 partner organisations, 50+ athletes and 5+ dietitians using the app in the first 3 months; 90% of pilot dietitians report the tool made their job easier; at least 70% of athletes in a team regularly follow the plans provided,” etc. Post-beta, as we launch commercially, traditional business metrics (number of paying clients, ARR, etc.) become relevant, but those are outside the scope of product functionality metrics per se.

In summary, success is a combination of **high usage, high satisfaction, and demonstrable improvement** in the efficiency and effectiveness of sports nutrition management. If elite teams find that our AI-driven app helps their staff **reach every athlete with personalised guidance effortlessly** (mirroring ZoneIn’s and Notemeal’s value propositions) and if athletes feel more supported and informed in their nutrition, then the product will have achieved its core mission.

## **Open Questions and Future Considerations**

While this PRD outlines a clear vision and initial scope, there remain open questions and future-oriented ideas that will need to be addressed as the product evolves:

- **Integration of Verified Nutrition Data Sources:** What food composition databases or APIs will we use to ensure accurate and comprehensive nutrition info? (USDA, Composition of Foods Integrated Dataset for the UK, or licensed databases like Nutritics?) This decision affects the completeness of our food library and will need consideration of licensing and updates. In MVP we might go with free databases, but long-term a more robust solution could be needed. Additionally, how will the system handle local foods or brand-name products, and will athletes be able to scan barcodes in future to log foods? These features are desirable down the line to streamline food logging.

- **AI Model Choices and Training:** What specific AI approaches will we employ for meal plan generation and insights? Options range from rule-based expert systems to machine learning models or even large language models for nutrition. An open question is how to continually improve the AI – e.g. will we gather anonymised data from all users to train a proprietary model that gets smarter over time? We must also consider the transparency and safety of AI suggestions: building an explanation system or constraints to avoid any harmful advice. Ensuring the AI stays within evidence-based guidelines is paramount (perhaps an expert review of AI outputs is needed initially).

- **Wearable and External Data:** Although not in MVP, we foresee integrating training load, sleep, and other data. We need to consider which integrations will yield the most value. For example, connecting with a platform like Garmin or Apple Health for calorie expenditure could unlock powerful insight (like automatic energy availability calculations). Also, integration with athlete management systems (e.g. Smartabase, Kitman Labs) could allow our nutrition data to merge with performance and injury data for holistic analysis. The priority and feasibility of these integrations (technically and via partnerships) is an open topic. A strategic decision is whether to position our product as a standalone specialist tool or aggressively integrate into the existing sports tech ecosystem as a component – feedback from beta clients and perhaps partnership opportunities (Teamworks/Notemeal’s path suggests integration can be valuable).

- **Regulatory and Compliance Considerations:** If our platform starts being used to store detailed health information (e.g. blood test results, injury rehab notes), at what point do we need to ensure compliance with healthcare regulations? For example, in the US, if the university sports nutrition program shares data with medical staff, could it be considered part of the athlete’s medical record (triggering HIPAA compliance)? In the UK/EU, GDPR is already on our radar for data privacy, but if we expand to younger athletes (e.g. under 18 academy players), child data protection laws also apply. We will need legal guidance as we scale to ensure we meet all necessary standards in each jurisdiction. This might influence features like data consent, retention policies, and who can access what data.

- **Monetisation Model:** Currently, the MVP is free. As we plan for GA, what will our pricing strategy be? Will it be a subscription per organisation, per athlete, or tiered by feature? We should consider how competitor pricing is structured (ZoneIn at \~$10-20K/year per team, likely enterprise pricing; Notemeal likely similar via Teamworks). An open question is whether to offer a free tier or trial for smaller programs (like high schools or individual trainers) or focus purely on elite institutions. How we monetise could affect product design – e.g. if charging per athlete, we might need better admin tools for counting active athletes, etc. This is more a business question, but it loops back to the product in terms of what usage we encourage or support.

- **Enhancing Athlete Experience:** The MVP is staff-driven, but long-term success also depends on athlete uptake. We need to continuously consider features that make the app compelling for athletes: gamification (badges for hitting nutrition goals), social or competitive elements (though privacy makes broad sharing tricky, maybe intra-team leaderboards for compliance?), and making the interface as engaging as popular consumer apps. A future consideration: would we ever open this platform direct to consumers (e.g. individual non-team athletes who want AI nutrition guidance)? That’s a different market (with competitors like MyFitnessPal, etc.), and our focus remains B2B, but it’s an idea that occasionally arises. For now, we remain focused on elite sports contexts.

- **Support for Special Scenarios:** There are niche but important use cases like handling athletes with eating disorders or RED-S (Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport) risk. ZoneIn’s founder mentioned features to help dietitians manage athletes at risk of disordered eating. We should consider down the line how our platform might include screening questionnaires or flags for such risks, and perhaps mode switches where certain data (like calorie counts) might be hidden from an athlete who could be triggered by them. These require expert input and careful design, but it’s worth keeping in mind as a differentiator in caring for athlete health holistically.

- **Data Ownership and Portability:** As multiple clubs and athletes use the system, questions of data ownership will come up. If an athlete leaves a team, can they retain their nutrition data or transfer it to their new team’s system (especially if both use our platform)? We have to define policies or tools for data export in such cases. Similarly, if a client decides to leave the platform, how do we ensure they can export their data easily (for trust, we should not “lock in” their valuable athlete history without a way to retrieve it). This also intersects with any AI model training on their data – we might need to allow them to opt out or delete data which our AI has used, depending on regulations or agreements.

In conclusion, while the core PRD defines what we’re building now, these open questions and future considerations highlight areas for strategic decision-making and innovation. We will address them in collaboration with our stakeholders (beta users, technical advisors, and possibly regulatory consultants) as the product matures. Keeping an eye on the competitive landscape and user needs will guide which of these considerations become priorities. The vision is to not only meet current standards but to continually push the standards of what an **AI-driven sports nutrition platform** can do for the performance community. By anticipating these questions, we ensure that our product can adapt and lead in this evolving domain.
