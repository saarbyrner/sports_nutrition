- [ ] **FOOD DATABASE**: Replace generic items with searchable nutrition database - BUILT BUT NOT CONNECTED
- [ ] **VISUAL TEMPLATES**: Rich template library with meal previews - BUILT BUT NOT ACCESSIBLE
- [ ] **SMART VALIDATION**: Real-time nutrition validation system - BUILT BUT NOT INTEGRATED

#### CRITICAL GAP: Components exist in `/meal-plan-creation/` folder but users cannot access them

### **CURRENT PRIORITY: Integration Phase** *(IMMEDIATE)*
**Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - FEATURES NOW ACCESSIBLE TO USERS**

#### Integration Tasks (What Users Actually See) - COMPLETED
- [x] **FIX DATABASE ERRORS**: Player loading failures and SQL query issues  
- [x] **CONNECT FOOD DATABASE**: Replace mock food data with real searchable database
- [x] **ADD TEMPLATE LIBRARY**: Make visual template browser accessible from UI
- [x] **INTEGRATE NUTRITION VALIDATION**: Show real-time nutrition feedback
- [x] **FIX CONTROLLED COMPONENT WARNINGS**: Select component state issues
- [x] **CONNECT WORKFLOW**: Make "Create Nutrition Plan" actually work with new components

#### ‚úÖ USER JOURNEY NOW COMPLETE:
1. **Multi-Modal Creation**: AI Generated, Template Library, Custom Build
2. **Real Food Database**: 2000+ foods with fuzzy search and nutrition data
3. **Visual Templates**: Expert-designed meal plans with rich previews
4. **Smart Validation**: Real-time sports nutrition feedback and scoring
5. **Progressive UX**: Step-by-step workflow with expert guidance

#### User Experience Goals - DEFERRED UNTIL BASIC FUNCTIONALITY WORKS
- [ ] Reduce creation flow friction by 60%
- [ ] Implement contextual help and guidance
- [ ] Add meal plan preview functionality
- [ ] Create consistent design patterns

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features** *(Weeks 5-6)*
**Status: ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED - Cannot proceed until integration phase complete**

#### Feature Development
- [ ] **AI INTEGRATION**: Real AI meal generation (replace mock implementations)
- [ ] **BULK OPERATIONS**: Multi-player plan management interface
- [ ] **COMPLIANCE**: Player adherence tracking and analytics
- [ ] **EXPORT/IMPORT**: PDF generation and data portability

### **Phase 4: Performance & Polish** *(Weeks 7-8)*
**Status: ‚è≥ PENDING**

#### Optimization Goals
- [ ] **PERFORMANCE**: Component optimization and code splitting
- [ ] **CACHING**: Efficient data fetching and state management
- [ ] **MOBILE**: Touch-optimized responsive interfaces
- [ ] **ANALYTICS**: Advanced nutrition trend analysis

```

### Component Structure
```
Current: Monolithic CreatePlanPage (1200+ lines)
Target:  Modular components with single responsibilities
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SetupFlow/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MealPlanBuilder/  
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NutritionValidator/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PreviewAndSave/
```

### Data Flow
```
Current: Mixed mock/real data with complex fallback logic
Target:  Unified data service with transparent caching
```
