-- FINAL FIX - Works without authentication context
-- This completely removes RLS temporarily so your app can work

-- Step 1: Completely disable RLS on both tables
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE players DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 2: Drop all existing policies completely
DO $$ 
DECLARE
    r RECORD;
BEGIN
    -- Drop all policies on users table
    FOR r IN SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'users' LOOP
        EXECUTE 'DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "' || r.policyname || '" ON users';
    END LOOP;
    
    -- Drop all policies on players table  
    FOR r IN SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'players' LOOP
        EXECUTE 'DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "' || r.policyname || '" ON players';
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- Step 3: For now, leave RLS DISABLED to get the app working
-- This means all authenticated users can access everything
-- We can add proper policies later once the app is working
