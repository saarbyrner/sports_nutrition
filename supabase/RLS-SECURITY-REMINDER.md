# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY TODO: Re-implement RLS Policies

## Current Status: 
üö® **RLS (Row Level Security) is DISABLED on `users` and `players` tables**

This was done as an emergency fix to resolve infinite recursion errors that were causing 500 server errors and making the application unusable.

## Security Impact:
- **Current Risk Level:** ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH
- **Current Access:** All authenticated users can access ALL user and player data
- **Production Risk:** Data can be accessed by unauthorized users

## What Was Disabled:
```sql
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE players DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- All RLS policies were dropped
```

## MUST IMPLEMENT BEFORE PRODUCTION:

### 1. Proper RLS Policy Strategy
The previous policies failed due to infinite recursion. We need to implement policies that:
- ‚úÖ Don't query the same table they're protecting
- ‚úÖ Use safe authentication methods (not recursive table lookups)
- ‚úÖ Provide proper admin vs user access controls

### 2. Recommended Approach:
```sql
-- Example safe policies (NOT the broken ones we had):
CREATE POLICY "users_own_data" ON users 
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- For admin access, use a separate admin_users table or JWT claims
-- DO NOT use: EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE...)
```

### 3. Testing Required:
- [ ] Test user can only see their own data
- [ ] Test admin can see all data in their organization  
- [ ] Test player creation works for admins
- [ ] Test no infinite recursion occurs
- [ ] Test no 500 errors occur

### 4. Alternative Security Approaches:
1. **Service Role Pattern:** Use service role for admin operations
2. **Separate Admin Table:** Create admin_permissions table to avoid recursion
3. **JWT Claims:** Use proper JWT metadata without table lookups
4. **Application-Level Security:** Handle permissions in application layer

## Files Related to This Issue:
- `FINAL-FIX-NO-AUTH-NEEDED.sql` - The emergency fix that disabled RLS
- `URGENT-FIX-INFINITE-RECURSION.sql` - Failed attempt using JWT
- `src/lib/services/player.ts` - Player creation service (now works but insecure)

## Timeline:
- **Emergency Fix Applied:** 2025-07-21
- **Production Deadline:** Before any production deployment
- **Priority:** HIGH - This is a security vulnerability

## Next Steps:
1. Get application fully functional with RLS disabled
2. Research proper RLS patterns for Supabase
3. Implement non-recursive policies  
4. Test thoroughly in development
5. Enable RLS with working policies
6. Verify no infinite recursion
7. Deploy to production only after RLS is properly secured
